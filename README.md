Squawk-VM-for-SunSPOT
=====================

This project is original form http://java.net/projects/squawk-spots, with GPL-2.0 licence.

squawk-spots project is an plugin for Squawk VM buidler to generate bin files for SunSpot device.

Although squawk-spots project is still alive, lots of information is lost, and codes are not well maintained.

I create this Squawk-VM-for-SunSPOT for my own research, and hoping I can make it more struecture.
